      It is good practice to
      
        x avoid 'T' and 'F', as they are just variables which are set to the logicals
          'TRUE' and 'FALSE' by default, but are not reserved words and hence can be
          overwritten by the user.  Hence, one should always use 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'
          for the logicals.
      
          'R/tf.R'
          'R/tf.R'
          'R/tf.R'
          'R/tf.R'
          'R/tf.R'
          ... and 4 more lines
